This was made to create the needed experimental files for DDIs predictions using BIOBERT (and not).
I used the MONGODB DRUGBANKS collection from the local computer in NCSR.


Initially the stats were the following:

DB 5.1.3: 

2641889 ALL | 1392809 (52.72 %) UNIQUE DDIS.
OUT OF THEM, IN DB 5.0.3 WERE: 236174 (16.96 %)
SO THE NEW ARE ACTUALLY: 1156635 (83.04 %)

DB 5.0.3: 
581055 ALL | 296326 (51.00 %) UNIQUE DDIS. 
OUT OF THEM, IN DB 5.1.3: 236174 (79.70 %) 
SO THE DIFFERENT ARE: 60152 (20.30 %)


We are focusing on UNIQUE drug pairs sorted by name of the first of the pair.

The following files were created:


- train_OLD_STR_ALL.txt
Comma separated values in the form h, r, t. No index or header.
r = 4 for all relations and h,t are strings with their DBids.

296326 from the unique drug pairs from 5.0.3


- test_CLEAN_STR_ALL.txt
Comma separated values in the form h, r, t. No index or header.
r = 4 for all relations and h,t are strings with their DBids.

1156635 from the unique drug pairs from 5.1.3 not found in 5.0.3

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ BIOBERT ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We utilize biobert to get embeddings for 12112 unique drugs.
We keep only the drug pairs that have embeddings for both drugs.
There are 3679 resulting unique drugs.


- train_OLD_STR_BIOBERT.txt (5588 were dropped from the previous train)
Comma separated values in the form h, r, t. No index or header.
r = 4 for all relations and h,t are strings with their DBids.

290722 from the unique drug pairs from 5.0.3 that have both embeddings for both drugs as fetched by BIOBERT


- test_CLEAN_STR_BIOBERT.txt (152468 were dropped from the previous test)
Comma separated values in the form h, r, t. No index or header.
r = 4 for all relations and h,t are strings with their DBids.

1004167 from the unique drug pairs from 5.1.3 not found in 5.0.3, that have both embeddings for both drugs as fetched by BIOBERT

- DB_Bert_Emb_STR.csv
The corresponding embedding file  containing only the 3679 unique drugs found from the previous work.
769 columns (with header, no index). The last column is the corresponding DB_ID.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ BIOBERT GNN ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Will re-create the train/test/embeddings file to be used by the torchkge platform.

- train_OLD_INT_BIOBERT.txt
The same as train_OLD_STR_BIOBERT.txt, were h, t have the integer mapping for the DB_ID. It starts from 0 and ends in 3678.


- test_CLEAN_INT_BIOBERT.txt
The same as test_CLEAN_STR_BIOBERT.txt, were h, t have the integer mapping for the DB_ID. It starts from 0 and ends in 3678.


- DB_Bert_Emb_INT.csv
The corresponding embedding file with the integer mapping. All other drugs have been dropped. 769 columns (with header, no index). The last column is the incremental ID.

-DB_Bert_Emb_INT__MAPPING.csv
The .csv file containing the mapping from the DB_ID to the incremental ID.
Comma separated, 2 columns with header (no index), ["DB_ID", "INDEX"]

THESE HAVE BEEN MOVED IN THE SUBFOLDER "CLEAN_DB_FOR_GNN" and renamed to train, test for cleaner interface.
